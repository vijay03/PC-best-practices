# PC-best-practices
Best Practices collected from different conferences regarding running a Program Committee. 

List of features I'd like the PC/review process to have:

1. **Early Rejects**. Papers rejected in round one of a multi-round review process should be notified early. Examples: ISCA 18, SP 2016, PLDI 2015. 
2. **Higher Standard for papers authored by PC**. Papers authored by the PC should be held to a higher standard. We should 
avoid having a majority of the papers being authored by the PC. Some conferences even have a separate external committee to review PC-authored papers. 
3. **No papers by the PC Chairs.** PC Chairs should not be allowed to submit papers, as it is hard to review their papers in an impartial and unbiased manner.
